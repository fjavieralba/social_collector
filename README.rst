bsch_social_monitor
===================

A proof of concept of openbus ideas applied to social media monitoring

This project is a quick implementation of some ideas behind the openbus project, applying them to the monitorization of realtime streams of data from social networks like twitter.

"Monitorization" here should be understood as being capable of detecting early problematic situations or opinions that customers are spreading.
